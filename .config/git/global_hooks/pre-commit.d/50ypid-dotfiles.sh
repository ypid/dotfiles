    # Deny to commit if repo uses pre-commit.com but hooks are not installed:
    # It should be implemented as assert. It should not run pre-commit hooks by
    # default without consent for security reasons. Manual install per project
    # is the preferred interface to achieve this.

    # LLM prompt: I want to make sure that if a git repo is using
    #   pre-commit.com, that I must have the hooks installed otherwise `git
    #   commit` or commit via a GUI would fail. How can I achieve this?
    # GPT-4o mini answer was not useful.
    #
    # Pro `git config core.hooksPath`:
    # * Works regardless of how git commit is done: GUI, CLI (alias).
    # * Installing can be done with `GIT_CONFIG=/dev/null pre-commit install`
    # * More flexible for possible future extensions that want to globally hook
    #   into git.
    # Contra `git config core.hooksPath`:
    # * `pre-commit install` is unsupported by pre-commit.com with
    #   core.hooksPath set:
    #   https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1198#issuecomment-844017639
    # * It requires to store hooks in the global hooksPath directory that
    #   call the equivalent local hook in $GIT_DIR/hooks for all existing hooks
    #   to not break expected behavior.
    #   https://medium.com/@ripoche.b/using-global-pre-commit-hook-to-prevent-committing-unwanted-code-edbbf957ad12
    # * It allows to easily overwrite this protection/warning that hooks
    #   exist but I have not installed them when I donâ€™t use my alias.
    #   I am so used to using my alias that this will not happen by accident.
