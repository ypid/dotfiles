# Shortcuts

Here are some common shortcuts that I use and which I configure in every program for which it makes sense and allows to do so. Programs which don’t allow me to configure shortcuts don’t stop me to follow my standards either by patching, opening an issue or as last resort by scripting using AutoKey or AutoHotKey.

## Advises: Shortcuts done right

Here is some advice regarding shortcuts for programmers and UI designers which I would like to see implemented:

* Allow more than one shortcut for one action!
* Allow to reconfigure *everything*.
* Make it easy to track the configuration files (which contain the shortcuts) with version control. This also means not to store the shortcuts together with things that you don‘t want to track (like recent files or usernames and passwords).
* When editing text in an input view then certain shortcuts are expected to work:
  * `Ctrl+A`: Select all
  * `Shift+Ctrl+A`: Select none
  * `Ctrl+Z`: Undo
  * `Shift+Ctrl+Y`: Undo (Maybe worth a thought because it is way easier to reach then Ctrl+Z)
  * `Ctrl+Y`: Redo
  * `Ctrl+U`: Delete line
  * `Ctrl+W`: Delete word
  * `Ctrl+H`: Delete character

* Do not reinvent the wheel!

## Shortcut “Namespaces”

Which shortcuts should be used where? – Some thoughts …

* `Shift+Alt`: W, S, X, A, D reserved for window manager. Applications can use everything else.
* `Super+Alt`: Hypervisor console as host key.
* `Ctrl+Super`, `Super`, `Ctrl+Alt`: Dedicated to window manager respectively shortcuts which can be triggered globally.
  * Never use the `Super` key for applications as this modifier might be reserved in some window managers. (And I don’t want to find out how to patch Windows to remap that).
* `Shift+Super`, `Shift+Super+Alt`: Dedicated to AutoKey or AutoHotKey (global)
    * Can also be used over RDP on Windows machines without interfering with MS Windows mappings of the Super key.
    * Note that `Shift+Super+Alt` is uncomfortable to enter. Only use for less frequent shortcuts.

### Applications

* `Ctrl`: Applications.
* `Shift`: Applications.
* `Shift+Ctrl`: Applications.
* `Shift+Ctrl+Alt`: Applications except Shift+Ctrl+Alt+O.
* `Shift+Alt`: With limitations, see above.

### Avoid

* Remapping `Alt+[A-Z]`

### No goes

* Never map `Alt+<letter>` where letter is a character which is located on the left of a QWERTZ keyboard.

## Free shortcuts

List of free shortcuts (they may have a default mapping but there are better shortcuts for those actions so that the shortcuts are available to be mapped to a different action).

* `Super` (WinKey): Almost forgotten :)
* Super+Alt+C
* Shift+Alt+
* Ctrl+Alt+Y
* Ctrl+Alt+[Level4 Shift][special-keys]
* Ctrl+Alt+E
* Shift+Super+Alt+

## Reserved shortcuts

Shortcuts which are reserved for non-public use at work.

* Shift+Alt+D

## Shortcut conventions and key order

To search for shortcuts, it is important to maintain a unique naming schema and order in which they are combined. This is pretty much based on the convention used by [Double Commander]:

* `Ctrl`
* `Shift`
* `Super`
* `Alt`
* `Non-modifier keys` (Letter, written in upper case for readability. The use of the shift modifier key is explicitly written down.)

### Special keys

Key name      | Comment
------------- | -------------
Level4 Shift  | This key in my configuration is the <> button.
\+            | Separator for keys
anything else | Is either a usual key name or a regular expression to specify a range of keys

## Window manager (e.g. Gnome3 or xfce)

Own shortcuts for the window manager should include the Super key which is normally not used by applications.

### Navigation

Left hand only: Should be easy to use with the left hand, because it is often used during work with the mouse. For example switching windows or Ctrl+C to copy to the clipboard.

Shortcut                           | Function                       | Left hand only | Comment

Alt+[Level4 Shift][special-keys]   | Switch windows                 | Of course      | Easier to reach than Alt+Tab.
Super+[Level4 Shift][special-keys] | Switch to workspace 1          | Of course      | Does not work on M$ Windows or would require Neo2 AHK patch.

Shift+Alt+W                        | Move window one workspace up   | Yes            | Not supported by windows-desktop-switcher on M$. I could implement it if I would really need it.
Shift+Alt+S                        | Move window one workspace down | Yes            | Not supported by windows-desktop-switcher on M$. I could implement it if I would really need it.
Super+1                            | Move window to workspace 1     | Of course      |
Super+2                            | Move window to workspace 2     | Of course      |

Super+5                            | Move window to workspace 5     | Of course      |
Super+6                            | Move window to workspace 6     | Of course      |

Super+J           | Launch application finder (Launcher)       | Nice to have   | Gnome activities or substation for other WMs. Gnome does by default trigger on Super button press which is a nice feature but does not work on other WMs yet?

## GUI applications

### Autokey

Here are the shortcuts I use to trigger [autokey][] actions.

#### Emitting keystrokes

The keystrokes are intended for the application and not to be trapped by the window manager.

#### Global

Shortcut      | Function        | Left hand only | Comment
------------- | -------------   | -------------  | -------------
Shift+Super+V | enter           | Yes            | Emit enter. If AltGr+v does not work (unfortunately AltGr can currently not be used in autokey). Unused. Reusing Shift+Super+V for something else.
Shift+Super+M |                 | Yes            | Emits F1. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+, |                 | Yes            | Emits F2. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+. |                 | Yes            | Emits F3. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+J |                 | Yes            | Emits F4. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+R | Reload          | Yes            | Emits F5. Most applications will either reload or go to presentation mode.
Shift+Super+L |                 | Yes            | Emits F6. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+U |                 | Yes            | Emits F7. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+I |                 | Yes            | Emits F8. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+O |                 | Yes            | Emits F9. Neo2 numbers.
Shift+Super+F | F11             | Yes            | Emits F11. Causes most applications to go in fullscreen.

### Clementine

#### Global

Shortcut      | Function                   | Left hand only | Comment
------------- | -------------              | -------------  | -------------
Ctrl+Alt+X    | `clementine --play-pause`  | Of course      | Play or pause audio. Using command line to also allow to start the program if no instance is running.
Shift+Alt+X   | `clementine --next`        | Of course      | Play next audio file
Ctrl+Alt+L    | `clementine --next`        | Of course      | Play next audio file
Ctrl+Alt+H    | `clementine --previous`    | Of course      | Play previous audio file
Ctrl+Alt+B    | `clementine --seek-by -10` | Nice to have   | Seek in audio file by *n* seconds.
Ctrl+Alt+N    | `clementine --seek-by 10`  | Nice to have   | Seek in audio file by *n* seconds.

<!-- Try with later version again.

### Application window only

Clementine - Not worth using global shortcuts for this.

Ctrl+Space | Rate the current song 0 star  | No |
Ctrl+M     | Rate the current song 1 star  | No |
Ctrl+,     | Rate the current song 2 stars | No |
Ctrl+.     | Rate the current song 3 stars | No |
Ctrl+J     | Rate the current song 4 stars | No |
Ctrl+K     | Rate the current song 5 stars | No |

### IDEs

Applies to: SikuliX, SciTE

Shortcut      | Function           | Left hand only | Comment
------------- | -------------      | -------------  | -------------
Ctrl+R        | Execute/run script | Nice to have   | The default seems to be F5 but I prefer easier to reach key combinations.
F5            | Execute/run script | Nice to have   | Fallback in case Ctrl+R is not yet configured for an application.


### Windows and tabs

Applies to: Firefox, Chromium, Double Commander, GNOME Terminal, ConEmu.

For GNOME Terminal (and ConEmu), each shortcut requires additionally the use of the Shift modifier key.

Shortcut       | Function                                | Left hand only | Comment
-------------  | -------------                           | -------------  | -------------
Ctrl+N         | Open new tab                            | No             | Easier to reach than Ctrl+T
Ctrl+W         | Close current tab                       | Of course      | Should be default in all program
Ctrl+T         | Open a new window                       | No             | Not as often used as "new tab", thus switched with it.
Ctrl+Q         | Closes the application                  | Of course      | Should be default in all program. FIXME: Drop this shortcut in favor of Super+Q. Done on: Windows.
Ctrl+Tab       | Switch to right tab, cycle through tabs | Yes            |
Shift+Ctrl+Tab | Switch to left tab, cycle through tabs  | Yes            |
Ctrl+J         | Switch to left tab                      | Not really     |
Ctrl+K         | Switch to right tab                     | Not really     |
Ctrl+[+-]      | Increase/Decrease (zoom) font size      | Nice to have   | Currently not supported in Double Commander. Level 3 [Neo2][] plus and minus work in Firefox (after setting the − via the Add-On Customizable Shortcuts). GNOME Terminal does not allow to configure „−” currently (can this be done in Gtk programs?). Works in ConEmu (without Shift).
Alt+M          | Switch to tab 1                         | No             | See [Neo2 layer4][Neo2]. Maybe blocks the use of Alt+[a-z]. I hope that most applications use letters which would be on the left side of a qwertz keyboard. FIXME: No, they wont!!!
Alt+,          | Switch to tab 2                         | No             |
Alt+.          | Switch to tab 3                         | No             |
Alt+J          | Switch to tab 4                         | No             |
Alt+K          | Switch to tab 5                         | No             |
Alt+L          | Switch to tab 6                         | No             |
Alt+U          | Switch to tab 7                         | No             |
Alt+I          | Switch to tab 8                         | No             |
Alt+O          | Switch to tab 9                         | No             |

ConEmu together with a lot of other "fine tuning" help to make the different shells on M$ somewhat usable.

To customize Firefox even further I use [Customizable Shortcuts](https://github.com/ttaubert/customizable-shortcuts).

### Chromium

I use [cVim][] to get all the Vim basics and to customize shortcuts.

### Double Commander (DC)

See the manual for the default shortcuts. I added my own which I think are more convenient.

Note that using `Shift+[A-Z]` currently has side effects when using the RenameOnly function [currently](https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/mantisbt/view.php?id=973) so I avoid to use `Shift+[A-Z]` for actions.

Hint: [Double Commander] works quite nicely together with [Neo2][] …

* Don’t restrict control to files panel for actions which are shown in the function key buttons area so that DC shows the mapping there too.

When looking for currently unassigned/free shortcuts, Double Commander has an awesome feature which can tell you the unassigend shortcuts. In ConfigHotKeys -> "Add hotkey" -> F1 symbol. Nice idea but seems not to work as of 0.8.4 beta?
